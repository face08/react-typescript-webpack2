# React, TypeScript, Webpack & Jest boilerplate

Lightweight boilerplate to kickstart your next [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) project.

Builds [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) through [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with [awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader) to provide sound type checking for your React components.

[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is also setup for TypeScript and ready to provide [snapshot tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html#content) and other cool testing features.
